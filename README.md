# STM-Nucleo-C-Tutorial
This repo helps users understand the basics of using the STM Nucleo, specifically the STM Nucleo WB55RG using the LabsLand service hosted at DigiKey.

# Introduction to the STM Nucleo
The STM Nucleo is a family of development boards created by STMicroelectronics, designed for rapid prototyping and testing with STM32 microcontrollers. Nucleo boards offer a versatile platform that combines power and ease of use, featuring a range of STM32 microcontrollers with ARM Cortex cores, from low-power to high-performance models. Each board comes with a built-in ST-LINK debugger/programmer, allowing for seamless programming without the need for an external debugger. Nucleo boards are compatible with the popular Arduino Uno form factor and STâ€™s Morpho connectors, providing extensive hardware compatibility with a wide array of shields and modules. Ideal for both beginners and professionals, STM Nucleo boards enable streamlined development for IoT, embedded systems, and other electronics applications.

# Introduction to the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

The **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)** for STM Nucleo boards is a software library developed by STMicroelectronics to simplify programming with STM32 microcontrollers. The HAL provides a high-level, abstracted API that allows developers to interact with the hardware without needing to manage low-level details, such as register configurations. By providing a unified interface for common peripheral drivers (GPIO, UART, ADC, etc.), the HAL library enables quicker development and enhances code portability across different STM32 models. With the HAL, developers can focus more on application logic and functionality rather than hardware-specific configurations, making it an excellent tool for both prototyping and scalable embedded development.
