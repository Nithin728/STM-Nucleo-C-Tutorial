# STM-Nucleo-C-Tutorial
This repo helps users understand the basics of using the STM Nucleo, specifically the STM Nucleo WB55RG using the LabsLand service hosted at DigiKey.

# Introduction to the STM Nucleo
The STM Nucleo is a family of development boards created by STMicroelectronics, designed for rapid prototyping and testing with STM32 microcontrollers. Nucleo boards offer a versatile platform that combines power and ease of use, featuring a range of STM32 microcontrollers with ARM Cortex cores, from low-power to high-performance models. Each board comes with a built-in ST-LINK debugger/programmer, allowing for seamless programming without the need for an external debugger. Nucleo boards are compatible with the popular Arduino Uno form factor and STâ€™s Morpho connectors, providing extensive hardware compatibility with a wide array of shields and modules. Ideal for both beginners and professionals, STM Nucleo boards enable streamlined development for IoT, embedded systems, and other electronics applications.
